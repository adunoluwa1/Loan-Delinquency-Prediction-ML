# Loan-Delinquency-Prediction-ML
-----------------------------------------
The Analytics team had been tasked to help the Collections team in the borrowers that are rolling
forward from an early due stage to later due stages. For that I was given a dataset that contained
customers that had been in an early due stage (1-30 days delinquent) and some of their main attributes.
I used python for the process (data preparation, exploration, and modelling)
I created a presentation sharing the process and final observations and recommendations
I applied machine learning to:
a) Predict whether the loan rolled or not rolled
b) What is your prediction accuracy
